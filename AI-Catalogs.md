# AI Catalogs

## 1. Model Catalogs

Databases of open and proprietary models (LLMs, vision, audio, etc.)

- [Hugging Face Models](https://huggingface.co/models) — the de facto registry for open models; searchable by architecture, license, and hardware requirements.
- [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library) — curated set of quantized models (Llama, Mistral, Phi, etc.) ready for local use.
- [OpenRouter Model List](https://openrouter.ai/models) — unified API and pricing index for hosted models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral, etc.
- [Replicate](https://replicate.com/explore) — model marketplace with API endpoints for images, audio, and text; great for testing multimodal models.
- [Together.ai Models](https://api.together.ai/models) — registry of open models served via a unified inference API.

## 2. Tool & App Directories

Focused on applications, UIs, and dev tools — the “AI software layer.”

- [There’s An AI For That](https://theresanaiforthat.com/) — consumer-facing catalog of over 10,000 AI apps; broad but not technically deep.
- [Futurepedia](https://www.futurepedia.io/) — similar directory with tags, pricing, and update frequency.
- [AIcyclopedia](https://aicyclopedia.com/) — community project focused on creating a structured directory of tools, categorized by workflow (text, code, image, video).
- [Awesome-AI](https://github.com/topics/awesome-ai) — GitHub tag leading to curated lists (Awesome-LLM, Awesome-AI-Tools, etc.) maintained by open-source developers.

## 3. Agent & Framework Compendiums

For developers building or integrating AI systems.

- [LangChain Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub) — searchable registry of chains, agents, and prompt templates.
- [OpenDevin Hub](https://github.com/OpenDevin) — early-stage collection of developer agent frameworks.
- [Claude Code Marketplace](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) — hosts plugins, subagents, and command templates for Claude Code (experimental).
- [LlamaIndex Hub](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/) — repository of data connectors and retrieval modules for local or cloud LLMs.

## 4. Infrastructure & Hosting Compendiums

For model runtimes, APIs, and inference engines.

- [Awesome-LLM Inference](https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM-Inference) — covers LocalAI, vLLM, TGI, SGLang, ExLlama, and others.
- [Local-AI Ecosystem](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI#ecosystem) — lists related UIs, tools, and model integrations around LocalAI.
- [MLOps Community Landscape](https://landscape.lfai.foundation/) — Linux Foundation’s structured overview of ML frameworks, hosting stacks, and orchestration tools.

## 5. Emerging Standards & Protocol Lists

For inter-tool interoperability and AI governance.

- [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) — official registry for MCP servers and documentation.
- [OpenAI Function Calling Schema](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) — reference for structured LLM calls.
- [Anthropic’s Server Registry](https://github.com/anthropics/mcp-server-registry) — listing of officially compatible Claude MCP servers.
- [OpenDevin Standards](https://github.com/OpenDevin/specs) — open spec for multi-agent developer workflows.
